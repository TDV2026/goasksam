# Lane coordination notes

Short, dated cross-lane heads-ups so two lanes don't collide on the same file. Append a line; remove it
when the work has landed.

- 2026-10-07 (Lane A): editing `api/history.js` (Lane C) for the search pass, authorized by Sam:
  VIN-page title to the spec pattern, the "back at auction now" live-listing link, dropping the VIN
  sitemap photo gate (index any VIN with 2+ priced appearances), and a server-side `logPageView` call.
  Also a one-line `logPageView` in `api/buy.js`. Small, additive; done same day.
